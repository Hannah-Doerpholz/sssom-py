## Attributes


### Own

 * [comment](comment.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Free text field containing either curator notes or text generated by tool providing additional informative information.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [creator_id](creator_id.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Identifies the persons or groups responsible for the creation of the mapping. Recommended to be a (pipe-separated) list of ORCIDs or otherwise identifying URLs, but any identifying string (such as name and affiliation) is permissible.
    * range: [Entity](Entity.md)
 * [creator_label](creator_label.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A string identifying the creator of this mapping. In the spirit of provenance, consider to use creator_id instead.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [license](license.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A url to the license of the mapping. In absence of a license we assume no license.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mapping_date](mapping_date.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: The date the mapping was computed
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mapping_provider](mapping_provider.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: URL pointing to the source that provided the mapping, for example an ontology that already contains the mappings.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mapping_set_id](mapping_set_id.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A globally unique identifier for the mapping set (not each individual mapping). Should be IRI, ideally resolvable.
    * range: [Entity](Entity.md)
 * [mapping_set_version](mapping_set_version.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A version string for the mapping.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mapping_tool](mapping_tool.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A reference to the tool or algorithm that was used to generate the mapping. Should be a URL pointing to more info about it, but can be free text.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mappings](mappings.md)  <sub>0..*</sub>
    * Description: Contains a list of mapping objects
    * range: [Mapping](Mapping.md)
 * [match_term_type](match_term_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Specifies what type of terms are being matched (class, property, or individual). Value should be ID from Term Match (SSSOM:TermMatch) branch of the SSSSOM Vocabulary.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [object_match_field](object_match_field.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A tuple of fields (term annotations on the object) that was used for the match. Should be used in conjunction with lexical and complexes matches, see SSSOM match types below.
    * range: [Entity](Entity.md)
 * [object_preprocessing](object_preprocessing.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Method of preprocessing applied to the fields of the object. Tuple of IDs from “Pre-processing method” (SSSOM:PreprocessingMethod) branch of the SSSSOM Vocabulary.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [object_source](object_source.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: IRI of ontology source for the object. Version IRI preferred.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [object_source_version](object_source_version.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Version IRI of the source of the object term.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [other](other.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Pipe separated list of key value pairs for properties not part of the SSSOM spec. Can be used to encode additional provenance data.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [see_also](see_also.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A URL specific for the mapping instance. E.g. for kboom we have a per-mapping image that shows surrounding axioms that drive probability. Could also be a github issue URL that discussed a complicated alignment
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [subject_match_field](subject_match_field.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: A tuple of fields (term annotations on the subject) that was used for the match. Should be used in conjunction with lexical and complexes matches, see SSSOM match types below.
    * range: [Entity](Entity.md)
 * [subject_preprocessing](subject_preprocessing.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Method of preprocessing applied to the fields of the subject. Tuple of IDs from "Pre-processing method" (SSSOM:PreprocessingMethod) branch of the SSSSOM Vocabulary.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [subject_source](subject_source.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: IRI of ontology source for the subject. Version IRI preferred.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [subject_source_version](subject_source_version.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
    * Description: Version IRI of the source of the subject term.
    * range: [String](types/String.md)
