## Attributes


### Own

 * [comment](comment.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: Free text field containing either curator notes or text generated by tool providing additional informative information.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [confidence](confidence.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: A score between 0 and 1 to denote the confidence or probability that the match is correct, where 1 denotes total confidence.
     * range: [Double](types/Double.md)
 * [creator_id](creator_id.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: Identifies the persons or groups responsible for the creation of the mapping. Recommended to be a (pipe-separated) list of ORCIDs or otherwise identifying URLs, but any identifying string (such as name and affiliation) is permissible.
     * range: [Entity](Entity.md)
 * [creator_label](creator_label.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: A string identifying the creator of this mapping. In the spirit of provenance, consider to use creator_id instead.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [information_content_mica_score](information_content_mica_score.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: A score between 0 and 1 to denote the information content of the most informative common ancestor, where 1 denotes the maximum level of informativeness.
     * range: [Double](types/Double.md)
 * [license](license.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: A url to the license of the mapping. In absence of a license we assume no license.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mapping_cardinality](mapping_cardinality.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: A string indicating whether this mapping is from a 1:1 (the subject_id maps to a single object_id), 1:n (the subject maps to more than one object_id), n:1, 1:0, 0:1 or n:n group. Note that this is a convenience field that should be derivable from the mapping set.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mapping_date](mapping_date.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: The date the mapping was computed
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mapping_provider](mapping_provider.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: URL pointing to the source that provided the mapping, for example an ontology that already contains the mappings.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [mapping_tool](mapping_tool.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: A reference to the tool or algorithm that was used to generate the mapping. Should be a URL pointing to more info about it, but can be free text.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [match_string](match_string.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: String that is shared by subj/obj
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [match_term_type](match_term_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: Specifies what type of terms are being matched (class, property, or individual). Value should be ID from Term Match (SSSOM:TermMatch) branch of the SSSSOM Vocabulary.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [match_type](match_type.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: ID from Match type (SSSOM:MatchType) branch of the SSSSOM Vocabulary. In the case of multiple match types for a single subject, predicate, object triplet, two seperate mappings must be specified.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [object_category](object_category.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: The conceptual category to which the subject belongs to. This can be a string denoting the category or a term from a controlled vocabulary.
     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [object_id](object_id.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: The ID of the object of the mapping.
     * range: [Entity](Entity.md)

     * range: [String](types/String.md)
 * [other](other.md)  <sub>OPT</sub>
     * Description: Pipe separated list of key value pairs for properties not part of the SSSOM spec. Can be used to encode additional provenance data.
